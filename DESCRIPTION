Description: The typicality and eccentricity data analysis (TEDA) framework was
    put forward by Angelov (2013) (DOI: 10.14313/JAMRIS_2-2014/16). It has been further developed into multiple
    different techniques since, and provides a non-parametric way of determining how
    similar an observation, from a process that is not purely random, is to other
    observations generated by the process. This package provides code to use the
    batch and recursive TEDA methods that have been published.
